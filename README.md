Employee turnover can adversely impact an organization’s financial outlook and performance, as well as crucial elements for company success such as reputa- tion, culture, and morale. Companies accrue costs associated with recruiting and training replacements, and costs such as paying out unused PTO. While most companies generally try to avoid employee churn due to the reasons mentioned above, there are situations where turnover can be beneficial for a company’s bottom-line. In situations where high-performing employees are replaced with less experienced or lower-performing individuals, the remain- ing employees must shoulder the burden of the departing employee. Conversely, when a poor performer is replaced with a high-performing individual, company productivity increases. In the latter scenario, retaining a poor-performing em- ployee for too long can be detrimental to the company.
