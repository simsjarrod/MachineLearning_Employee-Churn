## Project Overview
Employee turnover can adversely impact an organization’s financial outlook and performance, as well as crucial elements for company success such as reputa- tion, culture, and morale. Companies accrue costs associated with recruiting and training replacements, and costs such as paying out unused PTO. While most companies generally try to avoid employee churn due to the reasons mentioned above, there are situatiWith the implementation of HRIS, organizations have been gathering more quantity of data that has not been used in its full potential yet. Thus, interest in performing research on using predictive  analytics for employee churn has been growing in recent years.ons where turnover can be beneficial for a company’s bottom-line. In situations where high-performing employees are replaced with less experienced or lower-performing individuals, the remain- ing employees must shoulder the burden of the departing employee. Conversely, when a poor performer is replaced with a high-performing individual, company productivity increases. In the latter scenario, retaining a poor-performing em- ployee for too long can be detrimental to the company.With the implementation of HRIS, organizations have been gathering more quantity of data that has not been used in its full potential yet.

## Project Phases
1. **Data Collection**
    - The dataset for this project, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset), encompasses human resources data for 1,470 current and former IBM employees. It includes 36 features covering various demographic and performance-related aspects of employee satisfaction and attrition. 
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
    - Data cleaning and preprocessing was performed using Python as well as the Pandas library.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - This process includes the following steps:
        1. Importing necessary data and libraries
        2. Describing data using summary statistics
        3. Defining correlations between variables and identifying patterns in data using visuals
4. **Model Selection & Training**
5. **Analysis of Results**

## **Project Setup and Installation:**
1. Create a virtual environment
   ```
   python3 -m venv ds-venv
   ```

2. Activate the environment
     - On Windows:
      ```
      ds-venv\Scripts\Activate
      ```
     - On macOS and Linux
      ```
      source env/bin/activate
      ```
